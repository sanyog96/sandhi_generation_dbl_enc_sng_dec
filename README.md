# Sandhi Generation using Double Encoder and Single Decoder

This repository holds the script of Transformer architecture changed to include double encoders and single decoder to perform Sanskrit Sandhi Generation. 
What is Sanskrit Sandhi Generation? - ram and ishwaram when combined in sanskrit gives rameshwaram. You can see there was a change in the character "i" to "e" while combining two words.
I tried to achieve an architecture improvement and performance improvement over this task.
